 There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
 Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
 Example 1:
 nums1 = [1, 3]
 nums2 = [2]
 The median is 2.0
 Example 2:
 nums1 = [1, 2]
 nums2 = [3, 4]
 The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
 LintCode examples:
 Given A=[1,2,3,4,5,6] and B=[2,3,4,5], the median is 3.5.
 Given A=[1,2,3] and B=[4,5], the median is 3.

    Trivial: merge and find median. NOPE: have to be in log(m+n) time

Thoughts:
A[1,2]
B[3,4,5]
Assume after merge: [1,2,3,4,5], we'll be looking for the item in the mid.
Math: consider A[mid/2] and B[mid/2]. If A[mid/2]<B[mid/2], then it's safe to cut off all items before mid/2 = n/4;
they won't be in range for the median.
Same applies to when A[mid/2]>B[mid/2]
Approach: find kth number of two sorted array, k ~= (m+n)/2
- use startA, startB indexes to track the partition location
- Cut off half of one list at a time, recursively process the rest 3/4 of overall content.
- when k = 1, since A/B lists are sorted, should return the min
- Be careful with index: it's all 0 based

We are always discarding smallest in the smallest median and biggest in the biggest median.

Approach:
1) Find median in two sorted arrays
2) If mediana is smaller than medianb then median cannot be smaller than mediana and greater than medianb
3) Continue finding median till we have only one element left
4) At that point return the min
5) For even elements, the median will be at n/2 and n/2 + 1
6) For odd elements, median will be at n/2 + 1
7) This can also be used to find the kth smallest element in two sorted arrays.

n/2 and n/2 + 1 is position starting from 1

TC = O(log(m + n))
SC = O(1)
